# Programming Principals and Practice Chapters 6-7 Calculator
A calculator put together following chapters 6-7 of Programming Principales and Practice using C++.
Following chapters 6-7 were pretty hard. I think Bjorne explains these chapters pretty poorly given how complicated these two chapters are.
I'm uploading this in the event that someone wants to find a working example of chapter 6 and 7 to reference.
Keep in mind that this is the result of chapter 6 and 7 without completing any of the drills or exercises
(Because to be honest I'm too done with these chapters to bother doing anything more with this calculator).
I take no credit for this code since this was all written following Bjorne's book.
